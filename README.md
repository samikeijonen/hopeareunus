# Hopeareunus

Cool WordPress theme for business sites.

## Commercial Theme

Hopeareunus is a commercial Theme available in my site [Foxland](https://foxland.fi/downloads/hopeareunus/). The theme is hosted here
on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users alike.
If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, you can submit it here.

If you are using the theme on a live site it would be cool that you purchase a valid license from [Theme page](https://foxland.fi/downloads/hopeareunus/).
After that you get support and automatic updates.
