## Commercial Theme

Mina Olen is a commercial Theme available in my site [Foxland](https://foxland.fi/downloads/mina-olen/). The theme is hosted here
on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users alike.
If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, you can submit it here.

If you are using the theme on a live site it would be cool that you purchase a valid license from [Theme page](https://foxland.fi/downloads/mina-olen/).
